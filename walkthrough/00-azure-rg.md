## 00 - Create a Resource Group

>Don't choose UK South

Azure resources are grouped into "Resource Groups". Generally you'll see one resource group per project, or per environment (dev, uat, prd etc.).

We're going to create a Resource Group for our StoreIt project.

* Go into the Resource Groups panel, click Add
* Call your new Resource Group `storeit-rg`

It takes a couple of minutes to create resources, just wait and refresh.
